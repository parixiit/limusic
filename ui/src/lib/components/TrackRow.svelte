<!-- content-visibility, and only where `lazy` asks for it: a liked-songs list runs to thousands of
     rows and the browser keeps every one in style, layout and paint. 3.5rem is a row (8px padding,
     40px thumbnail, 8px); `auto` swaps in the measured size after first paint.

     It is not the free win it looks like, which is why it is opt-in now (issue #311). A row locking
     or unlocking changes the paint artifact, so on a list where rows cross the boundary on every
     frame the browser re-composites the whole region rather than sliding a layer. Measured in
     Chromium at 6x CPU throttling (`ui/perf/scroll.mjs`), frames over 20 ms across a wheel gesture:
     the queue panel pays 28% for it and 7% without, while Library ▸ Songs at 400 rows pays 8% with
     it and 29% without. The queue and the playlist page window their rows themselves
     (`rows.svelte.ts`), so they have nothing left for it to skip; the three paginated lists do.

     No `transition-colors`, and the hover-only controls below hide with `invisible`, not `opacity-0`
     (issue #311). Scrolling drags the whole list under a stationary pointer, so every row that goes
     past takes :hover and drops it again — with a transition that is a 150 ms repaint per row with
     several always in flight, and `opacity` below 1 puts an effect node in the paint property tree
     for every row, which Chromium re-walks on every frame it composites. Measured in Chromium at 4x
     CPU throttling (`ui/perf/scroll.mjs`), frames over 20 ms across a wheel gesture: queue panel
     50% -> 6%, Library > Songs 14% -> 1%. Hover still lands, it just lands at once. -->
