	// A horizontal shelf, drawn according to what it actually holds.
	//
	// Every shelf used to be the same row of square cards, which is exactly what YouTube Music does
	// and the reason a home feed reads as one undifferentiated wall. A square of artwork is the right
	// shape for an album and the wrong shape for everything else: a song needs its title and its
	// artist, an artist needs a face at a size you can see, a playlist needs to look like more than
	// one thing. So the shelf picks a form from the items:
	//
	//   songs     -> columns of readable, numbered rows you page through: no artwork worth showing,
	//                all information
	//   artists   -> tall poster frames with the name set on the photograph
	//   playlists -> a cover with the stack behind it showing
	//   anything else, or a mixed shelf -> the plain card, unchanged
	//
	// The rail, its arrows, the edge fades and the content-visibility budget are shared by all of
	// them; only the slot changes.

     the images around it, so hovering gets slower the further you scroll. Skipping off-screen
     shelves caps that at a screenful. The intrinsic size is a shelf of this form (heading + row);
     the `auto` keyword swaps in the real size once measured, so the scrollbar stays put. -->
