    // --- upgrading a database an older release wrote ------------------------------------------
    //
    // Every other file-backed test here starts from `Db::open`, which means from the *current*
    // schema, so none of them ever runs the ALTERs and one-shot migrations in `open` against a
    // file that actually needs them. These do. Each constant is the `execute_batch` SQL one shipped
    // release ran, copied verbatim from `git show <tag>:src-tauri/src/db.rs`. They are pinned as
    // literals on purpose: a schema generated from the current code would drift along with it and
    // stop being a record of what users' files really look like, which is the only thing that
    // makes the test worth having. Never edit one to make a test pass; add a new tag instead.
    //
    // Why these three:
    // - v0.4.11: `stream_url_cache` is five columns, `local_tracks` has no `album_artist`, no
    //   `accounts`. Every ALTER in `open` has work to do and both cache wipes fire. The long tail:
    //   .deb, .rpm and AUR installs never self-update, so some users really are on it.
    // - v0.5.12: has `is_video` and the ping columns but still no `accounts`, so it isolates the
    //   legacy single-session migration from most of the column work.
    // - v0.8.1: the predecessor of 0.8.2, which is where most self-updating installs sit. It lacks
    //   only `client`, so the one thing opening it does is the `client` wipe. The common path.
