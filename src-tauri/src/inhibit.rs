//! Hold off automatic suspend while music plays (#347).
//!
//! Linux only. Windows and macOS already keep the machine awake while an audio stream is open (the
//! audio driver's power request, coreaudiod's idle-sleep assertion); Linux desktops don't, so GNOME
//! suspended mid-song. Suspend only: the screen still blanks and locks as usual.
//!
//! Two session APIs, tried in order: `org.gnome.SessionManager` (GNOME and its forks) and
//! `org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Inhibit` (Plasma, Xfce). Not the Inhibit portal: gnome-session
//! up to 48 rejects an inhibitor without an app id, and the portal has none for an unsandboxed app
//! started from a terminal. Both drop our inhibitor when the bus connection closes, so quitting
//! mid-song leaves nothing held.
