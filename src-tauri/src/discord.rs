//! Discord Rich Presence via Discord's local IPC socket.
//!
//! Metrolist hand-rolls an OAuth2+PKCE login and a raw Gateway client because Android has no
//! Discord app to talk to — it has to authenticate *as the user* and push `PRESENCE_UPDATE`
//! itself. On desktop that whole stack is unnecessary: the running Discord client exposes an IPC
//! socket that accepts a presence payload directly. So there is no login, no token store, no
//! heartbeat, no reconnect strategy, and no `external-assets` header spoof — the local client does
//! all of it, and the identity is simply whoever is signed into Discord.
//!
//! Mirrors `media.rs`: the IPC client is blocking and stateful, so it gets an owner thread fed by a
//! channel. Everything here is best-effort — Discord not running, or quitting mid-song, is a
//! `debug!` line, never an error the user sees (context/16 fail-soft, same as the OS media widget).
//!
//! Presence is shown **only while actually playing**, unless the user turns on "show when paused"
//! (issue #226). Even then, a card needs playback to have started at least once this session: the
//! queue restored on launch is paused too, and a frozen "Listening to…" for a track nobody pressed
//! play on is worse than no card. A paused card also carries no timeline, because Discord has no
//! paused state and its progress bar would keep running.
//!
//! Timeline correctness hinges on three rules:
//! 1. A track change resets the thread's position to 0 — the app only ever starts tracks from the
//!    top, and trusting the previous track's stale position put every new song minutes in.
//! 2. Position messages carry the `Instant` they were *sent*, and the thread age-corrects — the
//!    event pump can lag seconds behind mpv (gapless advance resolves the next track over the
//!    network before draining more events), and an un-aged position "corrects" the timeline
//!    backwards.
//! 3. Only real mpv pause-flag transitions change `playing` — mpv fires `time-pos` on seeks while
//!    paused, so a position tick must never be treated as proof of playback.
//!
//! The socket is opened as soon as presence is enabled, not lazily on the first card — connecting
//! on demand meant the first song of a session waited out a connect round-trip (and a single failed
//! attempt stalled it for the whole retry interval) before anything showed up.
//!
//! Sending is rate-limited, because Discord silently drops presence updates that arrive too close
//! together — and a dropped update is invisible (the socket ACKs it). Two rules keep state from
//! getting stranded behind that: a **trailing-edge floor** (when a push is due but too soon, the
//! loop sleeps until the floor expires and then sends whatever is current — never discards it),
//! and a short **grace** on a brand-new track so its length can land before the first push. Without
//! the grace, a track change pushed a bar-less card and needed a second push milliseconds later,
//! which Discord dropped — leaving the card stuck as an elapsed counter with no progress bar.
