//! Phase 2: WEB_REMIX is the primary client (STS + PoToken + cipher/n-transform), with the
//! direct-URL client (VISIONOS) as graceful fallback and rustypipe as the
//! last-ditch net. The context/06 critical behaviors are preserved: metadata from MAIN, the
//! per-videoId WEB_REMIX failure memory, the HIGH two-pass, off-hot-path self-heal, and graceful
//! PoToken/cipher degradation. Every client is HEAD-validated (see the note in `resolve`); for an
//! upload a failed HEAD demotes the URL instead of rejecting it, because there is no anonymous
//! chain behind an upload to fall through to.
