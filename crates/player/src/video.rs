//! Music video, played by mpv itself.
//!
//! The picture is one more track of the audio file mpv is already playing (`video-add`), so picture
//! and sound run off one clock: a seek, a pause or a tempo change moves both, and there is nothing
//! to keep in step. mpv draws it one of two ways, and nothing here knows what it draws into:
//!
//! - through its render API into a GL surface the app owns (a GtkGLArea on Linux,
//!   `src-tauri/src/nativevideo.rs`): the app hands in a GL loader and a wake-up, and calls
//!   [`VideoRenderer::render`] on its GL thread;
//! - with its own video output, into a native window the app hands over
//!   ([`Player::set_video_window`], Windows: `src-tauri/src/nativevideo_windows.rs`).
//!
//! Videos are keyed by the audio URL mpv was handed, never by position in mpv's playlist, so the
//! gapless-next track's video can be registered minutes early and attaches itself the moment that
//! file becomes the one playing.
